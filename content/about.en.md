    <p>Sundex Optical ðŸ‘“ is an independent company specializing in the manufacturing of ophthalmic lenses, sun lenses, safety lenses, winter and extreme sports goggles, and all types of protective eyewear. We began as the Optical Lens Department of Mildex Optical Inc., a pioneer in PC lens manufacturing based in Taiwan.</p>
    <p>Sundex Optical has inherited over 20 years of technical expertise from Mildex Optical. We retained a cohort of elite and experienced employees who are now focused on a new goal: to professionalize and fine-tune Sundex's product line. Sundex will continue to develop practical and applicable products to meet future market demands.</p>
    <p>Now operating as an independent entity, we are intensely focused on the manufacturing and R&D of the latest ophthalmic lenses. Our core strength, as it has always been, lies in our production and coating technology. As a trusted channel for the distribution of ophthalmic lenses and eye care products, Sundex Optical Co., Ltd. inspires confidence, provides comprehensive product guarantees, and creates value for our customers.</p>
    <p>Sundex is proud of its successful QA system, R&D capabilities, and fully automated production equipment.
